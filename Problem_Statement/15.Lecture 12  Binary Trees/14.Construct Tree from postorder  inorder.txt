Coding Problem
Problem Statement: Construct Tree from postorder  inorder
Problem Level: MEDIUM
Problem Description:
For a given postorder and inorder traversal of a Binary Tree of type integer stored in an array/list, create the binary tree using the given two arrays/lists. You just need to construct the tree and return the root.
Note:
Assume that the Binary Tree contains only unique elements.

Input Format:
The first line of input contains an integer N denoting the size of the list/array. It can also be said that N is the total number of nodes the binary tree would have.

The second line of input contains N integers, all separated by a single space. It represents the Postorder-traversal of the binary tree.

The third line of input contains N integers, all separated by a single space. It represents the inorder-traversal of the binary tree.

Output Format:
The given input tree will be printed in a level order fashion where each level will be printed on a new line. 
Elements on every level will be printed in a linear fashion. A single space will separate them.

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^4
Where N is the total number of nodes in the binary tree.

Time Limit: 1 sec

Sample Input 1:
7
4 5 2 6 7 3 1 
4 2 5 1 6 3 7

Sample Output 1:
1 
2 3 
4 5 6 7

Sample Input 2:
6
2 9 3 6 10 5 
2 6 3 9 5 10

Sample Output 2:
5 
6 10 
2 3 
9
